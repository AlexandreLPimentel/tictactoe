This is a little program I did back in highschool when I learned just basic C (didn't even learn pointers). Note that it is in Portuguese.

Compile and run the game with a generic C compiler like gcc and press a number between 1 and 9 to play when the last line in the command prompt says "Indique a posicao.". When you lose or tie the game, press s and enter to play again or n and enter to exit.

1|2|3

4|5|6

7|8|9

This is how the numbers are set up when you want to decide where to play. Don't input a letter when asked to play, unless you want an infinite cycle to lock your computer.
